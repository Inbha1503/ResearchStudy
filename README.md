# Retail Profitability Research

This project investigates the impact of discount strategies on retail profitability using transactional sales data.

## Overview
 - Conducted exploratory, statistical, and predictive analysis on 9,994 retail transactions to study the impact of discount strategies on profitability
 - Applied Welch’s t-test and correlation analysis to statistically validate discount–profit relationships, identifying a significant negative impact of discounting
 - Built an interpretable regression model to quantify feature influence, confirming discount as the strongest negative predictor of profit

## Objectives
- Analyze sales, discount, and profit patterns
- Statistically test the effect of discounts on profit
- Build an interpretable predictive model

## Methods
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Hypothesis Testing (Welch’s t-test, Correlation)
- Linear Regression Modeling

## Key Findings
- Discounts have a statistically significant negative impact on profit
- High sales volume does not guarantee profitability
- Discount level is the strongest negative predictor of profit

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
